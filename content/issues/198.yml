description: "Hi all,

  Hope everyone has a great week ahead. This week we focus on deadlock and concurency primitive.

  Thank you to the readers who have [bought me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/betterdev), really appreciate that ❤.️"

      Many might have seen PostgreSQL issue the following error message: "ERROR: deadlock detected". But what does it really mean? How can we prevent a deadlock and how can we reproduce the problem? Let’s dive into PostgreSQL locking and understand what deadlock and deadlock_timeout really mean.

      Concurrent programming requires synchronization. We can’t have more than one thread accessing data at the same time; otherwise, we end up with a data race.
      The most common solution is to wrap the critical data access in a mutex.
      When misused, it can cause a program to run worse in threaded mode than it would have single threaded!

      Now we know about mutex, then how about futexes, which are popup sometime especially when you are working with strace.
      Futex mechanism was proposed by Linux contributors from IBM in 2002 [1]; it was integrated into the kernel in late 2003. The main idea is to enable a more efficient way for userspace code to synchronize multiple threads, with minimal kernel involvement.

      (or any static file hoster). So how do you use a database on a static file hoster? Firstly, SQLite (written in C) is compiled to WebAssembly. SQLite can be compiled with emscripten without any modifications, and the sql.js library is a thin JS wrapper around the wasm code.
      It also leverage HTTP Range header, which we cover in [issue #196](https://betterdev.link/issues/196)

      With an increasing number of breaches, intrusions, and data thefts, securing a web application is extremely important.
      On the other hand, programmers often do not have a strong grasp of how attacks work and how to mitigate them. This post attempts to close that gap a little.

      So how these simulations were achieved? A good post to learn about image maniupulation, vector
