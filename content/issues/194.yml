      This is a JavaScript package but you should give it a read to be more carefully when parsing data that can be represent in different notation. Example, what would you think `0127.0.0.1`? The ip actually is `87.0.0.1`

    description: |
      PostgreSQL uses a cost-based query optimizer that tries to turn your SQL queries into something efficient that executes in as little time as possible. For many people, the workings of the optimizer itself remain a mystery, so we have decided to give users some insight into what is really going on behind the scenes.

Then a linker assembling all these object files into one big program and create the final executable files. But most of Linux code use dynamic linking, means its object files are absence. At run time, it will borrow the file. Sound magically? Let's dig in. Make sure to check [part 2](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-2/) as well."

    description: |
      One way to improve shell workflows is finding patterns in the execution order of commands and extracting those into little scripts; this can often be helpful and is part of what makes working in a shell so powerful. Another way is to understand how the parameters are added and try to simplify this; that‚Äôs what I will focus mostly on in this blog post.
