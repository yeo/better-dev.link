  Hi all,

  Last week I was busy working on an IMAP implementation for my [email forwarding app](https://hanami.run) and also have some consultant work so the issue was put aside. This week we're resuming our normal schedule.

       SSDs are more complicated and their performance behavior can appear quite mysterious if one simply thinks of them as fast disks. The goal of this post is to provide an understanding of why SSDs behave the way they do, which can help creating software that is capable of exploiting them. (Note that I discuss NAND flash, not Intel Optane memory, which has different characteristic

      One of famous joke about JS is `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004` but that is infact occurs in many languages just because that IEEE 754 standard.
      Instead of talking about the stupid jokes, the author dive in to write about his library to play with arbitrary precision numbers. Great post.
