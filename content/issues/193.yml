    description: "Network segment, broadcast address, VLAN, subnet mask. If you feel dizzy with these terms then check out this post. It's a nice recap of IP networking which we may overlook when working on higher layers such as backend or frontend. Even if you aren't a network engineer, this helps you when setting up AWS VPC for example"

If you like gory details, the UCA is both fascinating and terrifying (my favourite part is \"backward accent ordering\" which shows up in some French variants but not others)."

The Twitter user, SAXX, shared a partially redacted private RSA key in a tweet about a penetration test where they had recovered a private key. Precisely, a screenshot of a PEM was shared online with 31 of 51 total lines of the file redacted."

    description: |
      We linked to this blog of Kristian KÃ¶hntopp a few time. Today is a new post about a complicated MySQL setup. The databases are being organized in replication hierarchies, and each hierarchy is a tree topology with a single primary and a number of intermediate replicas. And yes, it really is a lot of databases

    description: |
      A core component of Uber networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from applications to the edge infrastructure. Uberâ€™s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uberâ€™s data centers without significantly impacting the userâ€™s experience.
