      USB-C promises to use one port for everything. USB-C converters to DisplayPort or HDMI are common and inexpensive. USB-C hubs with external monitor support are also common, but understanding their capabilities and limitations can be extremely confusing. Some are Mac-compatible and some aren’t. Some need driver software

    description: "One frustrating thing that can happen to your database has nothing to do with performance and queries. Rather, it’s running out of disk space to store data. Today we’ll drill into some good practices you can put in place to help prevent such from happening. And if it does, show how to get you out of a bind as quickly as possible."

      If a substring would be compared in reverse order, things may be different. For example, we search for a 'CAT' substring in 'HORSE TURTLE CAT' string.  With naive algorithm, we will first compare 'H' and 'C', we see they are unequal characters and we will advance substring one character ahead. But if we start at the end of sub string `CAT` we can jump back 3 character at a time.

    description: |
      A private IP address is an IP address that's reserved for internal use behind a router. They cannot be routed on the internet, only in LAN. 10.0.0/8 is private address spaces and we can guess the reason to choose it, easy to type and remember. But what's about 192.168/16?
