  Beside our normal link, this week I want to say about what I have been working on.

  Due to lock down policy, I have more time to work on my [side project](https://hanami.run?bd). Today I'm launching [hanami.run](https://hanami.run?bd), a [service to forward email](https://hanami.run?bd) from your custom domain to your own personal email.
  If you have a domain, you can use any arbitraty username@your-domain.com to register for service like newsletter, website. If anyone leak your email address, you know who sold your email addresses.

  If you want to receive emails to your own domain, then give [hanami.run](https://hanami.run?bd) a try.

    description: "This is the original title of this post but I don't see how simple it's at all :-). It's too complex I must say to use. But I think the author mean simple in term that you can understand it and break it down and even build your own container network with your own hand, use standarize linux command without writing a single line of code. Still a good post to understand how network is setup and configure between containers, you will learn tool like netns for network namespace, nsenter to interact with linux namespaces."

      By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people.

      There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways: Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand why. While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work

      on every single software project or product I’ve worked on, JSON serialization has been a endless source of pain and bugs. It’s a push stream of trouble. Why is that so? What is so inherently complicated in the problem of JSON serialization that we always, by necessity, struggle with it?
