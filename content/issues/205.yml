  Crypto is going chao last few weeks but when looking at it purely from an engineering purspective, it's quite interesting system.

  Have fun enterainment with these links. Happy monday."

    description: "
      Usually when programming we call a public api on an object and the real works are being done. We don't know exactly what happen under the hood. Imagine you read a file, you call `fopen` or `fseek` but that's that. Who move the hard drive tip? who fetch the data from hard drive and put it to memory so your program can access it? The way to know that is working directly with the protocol instead of relying on the SDK. Today, we do the same with Bitcoin. It's written by Tesla AutoPilit director"

      After an almost stellar 2 year uptime, on 22nd of June, bunny.net experienced a 2+ hour near system-wide outage caused by DNS failure. In a blink of an eye, we lost over 60% of traffic, and wiped out hundreds of Gbits of throughput. Despite all of these systems being in place, a very simple update brought it all crumbling down, affecting over 750.000 websites.

    title: "Serving sharp images to high density screens"
    description: "
       in 2010 the iPhone 4 came out, and the screen was 640×960, whereas the similar-sized iPhone 3 was 320×480.
       The resolution doubled, while the screen size was roughly the same, so in effect the screen density doubled.
       Apple couldn't just run the same apps but at a higher resolution, because things like text and buttons would be tiny, so they doubled the size of everything. 1 pixel became 2 'device pixels'.
       On the web we call this the 'device pixel ratio', or DPR. The iPhone 4 had a DPR of 2. This is sometimes referred to as having a 2x screen, or 2dppx.
       So you see the mess?"
