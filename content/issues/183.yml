      Exploring a new repository can certainly be a daunting task. Many angles come at play - familiarity with the languages, understanding of the tools or frameworks used, how components integrate with each other, what paradigm is used by the developers, etc. The points mentioned in this section will present you with approaches to make this journey smoot

      How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server.
      But Steamâ€™s login page doesnâ€™t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.
      Iâ€™ll be discussing Steamâ€™s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.

      Most of the GitHub products you interact with are in a large Ruby on Rails monolith. Monolithic codebases are common for many high-growth startups, and itâ€™s a difficult situation to detangle yourself from. One of the pain points we had was problems with the on-call system for our monolith.

      The lessons Dropbox has learned in incident management. You probably wonâ€™t find all of these in a textbook description of an incident command structure, and you shouldnâ€™t view these improvements as a one-size-fits-all approach for every company. (Their usefulness will depend on your tech stack, org size, and other factors.) Instead, we hope this serves as a case study for how you can take a systematic view of your organizationâ€™s own incident response and evolve it to meet your usersâ€™ needs

    description: |
      Without TCO many recursive functions can blow up the stack causing a stack overflow.
      Therefore by teaching people about TCO in the context of recursion, you can teach them why optimizing compilers (or interpreters) can run tail recursive code efficiently and without causing a stack overflow.
