description: "Hi all,

  Hope everyone has a great week ahead. For any readers who are in Gaza, stay safe, I hope everything will be fine.

  This week, we have many article that focus on high level concepts to help you relax and take a break from our last 2 intensive issues.

  Thank you to the readers who have [bought me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/betterdev), really appreciate that ❤.️"

      Rocket, SpaceX achievements are so greats. It would be really good to see how they built their software. StackOverFlow spoke with Steven Gerding, Dragon’s software development lead, about the special challenges software development has for SpaceX's many missions.

      QuestDB billed itself as "the fastest open source time series database", a very bold one. I can query 1.6mil rows in milliseconds.
      This is a high level overview of what they did to achieve that, The Problem with out-of-order data.

      RedShift is almost de-factor Data Warehouse solution, especially for people already on AWS eco system. But what is for the rest of us who still on bare metal or run our own database on VM? What can we do to tune PostgreSQL for that purpose.

    title: "Multiplying huge integers using fourier transforms"
    description: |
      Multiplying huge integers of n digits can be done in time O(n log(n)) using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), instead of the O(n 2) time complexity normally required. In this paper we present this technique from the viewpoint of polynomial multiplication, explaining a recursive divide-and-conquer approach to FFT multiplication. We have compared both methods of multiplication quantitatively and present our results and conclusions in this paper, along with complexity analyses and error bounds.

      Daniel, author of curl was trying to explaining the main libcurl transfer state machine.
      Understanding the main transfer state machine in libcurl could be valuable and interesting for anyone who wants to work on libcurl internals and maybe improve it.
