  Hi all,

  Happy holiday for US reader. We have quite a few interesting tool of this week. Check them out.

  For video, let's sit down and listen to Louis Pilfold, creator of Gleam lang, talks about trade off of dynamic language, Rust vs Elixir, willing to throw away your first version on refactor it. I learn a lot and I hope you do too"

      Ever wondered how regex works under the hood? How does it understand an incantation like "<\/?[\w\s]*>|<.+[\W]>" and magically produces a desired result? This 3 parts serie is going to describe exactly how it works and how to implement a feature-rich regex engine.

    title: "How /proc/self/mem writes to unwritable memory"
    description: |
      An obscure quirk of the /proc/*/mem pseudofile is its ‚Äúpunch through‚Äù semantics. Writes performed through this file will succeed even if the destination virtual memory is marked unwritable. This behavior raises some questions: Is privileged code subject to virtual memory permissions? In general, to what degree can the hardware inhibit kernel memory access?

    description: |
      Today, we can find elliptic curves cryptosystems in TLS, PGP and SSH, which are just three of the main technologies on which the modern web and IT world are based. Before ECC become popular, almost all public-key algorithms were based on RSA, DSA, and DH, alternative cryptosystems based on modular arithmetic. And the foundations of ECC are still a mystery to most. In this we have this link to dive into ECC, and another great one [Elliptic Curve Cryptography: a gentle introduction](https://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/)

      Web developers have come to expect little to no performance impact when debugging their code. However, this expectation is by no means universal. A C++ developer would never expect a debug build of their application to reach production performance, and in early years of Chrome, simply opening DevTools significantly impacted the performance of the page. This post laid out what Chrome team did to improve their
