  Hi all,

  Every companies has to have a CI/CD and also have to organize code. This week I got links on that topic. Jenkins, code organization and a few WebAssembly/CSS links. Grab a cup of coffee to go through some. Happy monday.

      From the look of it, OOP is here to stay.
      Despite having gone through serious mutations, OOP is still strongly criticised by knowledgeable people.
      Worse, the game industry seems to be moving away from it. Video games are simulations, a core niche of OOP.

      Slack had a  a sophisticated Jenkins infrastructure. One day their Jenkins UI stopped working although the jobs continued to run. This post is a breakdown of how we ended up in this state and how we fixed the problem. From this experience, weâ€™re also sharing some general-purpose tips on troubleshooting a Jenkins issue.

    description: "In OOP codebase, the most popular method is to group by layer. Think Model/View/Control.
      Which is bad as the author argue. A better approach they suggest is to group by entity. all classes related to a single concept stay together. This is also the concept in Elixir's Phoenix framework"

    description: |
      JavaScript in the browser runs many times faster than it did two decades ago. And that happened because the browser vendors spent that time working on intensive performance optimizations.
      But what if youâ€™re running JavaScript in a Serverless function? Or if you want to run JavaScript in an environment that doesnâ€™t allow general just-in-time compilation, like iOS or gaming consoles? WebAssembly!

    description: |
      As with any hardware, PCIe-based components are susceptible to different types of hardware-, firmware-, or software-related failures and performance degradation. The variety of components and vendors, array of failures, and the challenges of scale make monitoring, collecting data, and performing fault isolation for PCIe-based components challenging.

      Understanding trigonometry can give us super powers when it comes to creative coding. But to the uninitiated, it can seem a little intimidating. In this 3-part series of articles weâ€™ll get an overview of trigonometry, understand how it can be useful, and delve into some creative applications in CSS and JavaScript.
